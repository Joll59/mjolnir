# Contributing to Mjolnir.

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Mjolnir!

There are many ways that you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? please ask away, for now, you can open an issue. Before you open issue though, check the issues to be sure it wasn't already asked. 
Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in Mjolnir? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Identify Where to Report

Mjolnir is currently in a single repository. Try to file the issue against the master branch of this repository.

Can you recreate the issue ?

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/joll59/mjolnir/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/joll59/mjolnir/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote


If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of Mjolnir

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occuring

* A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally

  * **Note:** Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Recreate the issue

* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!

### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, your report will go into the issue tracking work flow. Be sure to understand what will happen next, so you know what to expect, and how to continue to assist throughout the process.
<!--[issue tracking](https://github.com/joll59/mjolnir/wiki/Issue-Tracking)-->
